# Assets

This directory contains the app assets. You'll need to add the following files:

- `icon.png` - App icon (1024x1024px)
- `splash.png` - Splash screen image
- `adaptive-icon.png` - Android adaptive icon
- `favicon.png` - Web favicon

You can generate these using tools like:
- Expo's asset generation tools
- Online icon generators
- Design tools like Figma, Sketch, or Canva

For now, the app will work without these assets, but they're recommended for a polished look.
